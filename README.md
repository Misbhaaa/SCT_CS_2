# 🖼️ Image Encryption & Decryption Tool – Pixel Manipulation | SCT_CS_Task2

This project is submitted as **Task 2** of the **Cyber Security Internship** offered by **SkillCraft Technology**.

## 🧩 Task Objective
Build a simple **Image Encryption Tool** using **pixel-level manipulation**. The goal is to apply basic mathematical operations or pixel value transformations to encrypt and decrypt images.

## 🔐 What It Does
- Encrypts an image by modifying the RGB values of each pixel (e.g., inverting, shifting, or swapping values)
- Decrypts the image by reversing the applied operations
- Ensures visual distortion for encrypted output, and perfect recovery on decryption
- Offers a basic **Tkinter GUI** to select files and perform actions easily

## 🛠️ Features
- 🧮 Pixel-level encryption using RGB channel manipulation
- 🔄 Reversible decryption to original image
- 🖥️ Simple graphical interface using **Tkinter**
- 📂 File browser for selecting images
- 💡 Supports `.png`, `.jpg`, and `.jpeg` formats

## 🚀 How to Run

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PIL (Pillow library)

### Installation
pip install pillow


### Running the App
python image_encryptor.py
